This site is basically a sandbox for me to play in as I learn WordPress. It is hosted on my local machine using MAMP. It is built on the Genesis Framework, using a customized child theme. Caching is done with WP Super Cache, and it is backed up to Dropbox daily using BackWPup.

Editing is done with Sublime Text, and revision control through GitHub, using SourceTree.

My Plugins:
* BackWPup
* Genesis Visual Hook Guide
* Jetpack
* Yoast SEO
* WP Migrate DB
* WP Super Cache
